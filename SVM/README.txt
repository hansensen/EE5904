MATLAB file instructions:
1. get_alpha.m is a utility file.
2. svm.m is a utility file.
3. svm_hard_linear_kernel.m is implementation of hard-margin with linear kernel.
4. svm_hard_poly_kernel.m is implementation of hard-margin with polynomial kernel.
5. svm_soft_poly_kernel.m is implementation of soft-margin with polynomial kernel.
6. svm_find_optimal_c.m is the implementation of finding the best C for task 3.
7. svm_task3.m is the implementation of task 3 of SVM project. To run this script, eval.mat is needed.
